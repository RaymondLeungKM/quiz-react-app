1. Need to make the layout better (wait till the end)
(sort of done) 2. Need to make an admin panel for adding new quizzes, questions and answers
(done) 3. Need to force submitting the answers when the time is up; Need to modify the backend so that when an answer is null or sth it automatically treats the answer as incorrect
(done) 4. Add user preference of dark mode in local storage such that it persist page refresh
(done) 5. At least 1 answer must be chosen as the correct answer
(done) 6. Lets add some default order values to both questions and answers.. (might be even hide them.. just kind of add the values in the background)
7. Add register login logout functionalities
8. Add record for quiz results
9. Login => only show quiz created by / accessible by user; block manual input in url
10. Maybe add a chatgpt integration?
11. jwt implementation for the frontend; Should pass the token in subsequent request after user logged in! Maybe we can also implement the auto refresh token or expires => log out function

minor
1. Click category => filter quizzes with the same category
2. Make a dedicated home page..
3. Transitions/effect (e.g. framer motion)
